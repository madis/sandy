What is bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be sent electronically from one user to another without the need for a middleman, such as a bank or government, so this means it is decentralized . Transactions are recorded on a public ledger called a blockchain, which allows for transparency and security. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by an individual or group of individuals using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It is the first and most widely known cryptocurrency.
This is the money of freedom.
