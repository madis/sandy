Since a couple of decades ago El Salvador has become a destination for surfing, we have the best waves in Central America, the perfect weather for surfing in a simple swimsuit, and we have hosted and participated in different international surfing competitions. If you have never surfed, there is no excuse not to try, in these beaches there are surf schools that invite you and encourage you to practice this sport, where for a reasonable price you can have a coach, board, rash, sunscreen and some schools even they offer you a video session and an entire surf camp.
